prop value
prop onChange

# Hello!

You can edit this text to change the output. The `value` prop starts as `null`, but you can change it by passing `onChange` to an `<input>` element.

But first, may I kindly ask your name?

<input
  value={value}
  onChange={onChange}
  autoFocus
/>

<p>{value && `Thanks, ${value}!`}</p>
